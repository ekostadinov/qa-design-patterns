## Intent
Is useful for problems for which no deterministic solution strategies are known.
In Blackboard several specialised sub-systems assemble their knowledge to build a possibly partial or approximate solution.


## Applicability
Use Blackboard when

* There is an immature domain in which no closed approach to a solution is known or feasible.
