# Design patterns QA - PoC 

# Implemented in CSharp

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmers can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system. They can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

# Getting started

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
[Programming/Software Design Principles](http://webpro.github.io/programming-principles/).

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.
