## Intent
Used to implement the concept of software modules, defined by modular programming,
in a programming language with incomplete direct support for the concept.


## Applicability
Use the Module pattern when

* want to manage the creation and organization of other elements
* can provide the equivalent of a namespace, providing the initialization and finalization process of a static class or a class with static members with cleaner, more concise syntax and semantics
* supports specific cases where a class or object can be considered structured, procedural data
